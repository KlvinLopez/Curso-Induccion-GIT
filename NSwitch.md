# Nintendo Switch
## From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The **Nintendo Switch**,[b] commonly abbreviated as the _Switch_, is a video game console developed by Nintendo and was released on March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid console, which means it can be used as both a home console and as a portable console. In the home console mode, the main unit is inserted onto a docking station to connect to a television screen or monitor. Alternatively, for portable use, it can be removed from the dock and operated similarly to a tablet computer through its LCD touchscreen.
